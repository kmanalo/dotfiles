Note on agm files produced by PENMSHXP for YGROUP
The material-averaged importances are given in 'forward group' order.

Scripts:
agm_to_column.py (flux.agm --> br3pin.agm)
plot_agm.sh
pullplot_error_norm.sh
pullplot_spc.sh

Scripts generate gnuplot based png outputs:

agm.png
enorm.png
spc.png

agm.png - transposed flux.agm --> br3pin.agm and plotted vs. forward group
spc.png - br3pin.spc --> br3pin2col.spc and plotted of adjoint 'fission xs' source
enorm.png - br3pin.crs --> br3pin.enorm and plotted error norm vs. loose index (cm,grp)
